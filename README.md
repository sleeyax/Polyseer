# Polyseer - See the Future.

## 👉 **Just Use the Hosted Version: [polyseer.xyz](https://polyseer.xyz)** 👈

Seriously, unless you're a developer who wants to modify the code, just use the hosted version. It's free, already set up, and works immediately. No setup required.

---

**Still here?** Okay, you must really want to run this locally. Here's how:

## Quick Start (Development Mode)

This is the simplest way to run Polyseer on your computer. No authentication, no database setup required.

### What You Need
- **Node.js 18+** - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- **pnpm** - Install with: `npm install -g pnpm`
- **OpenAI API Key** - Get from [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com)
- **Valyu API Key** - Get from [platform.valyu.ai](https://platform.valyu.ai)

### Setup (5 minutes)

1. **Clone the repo:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yorkeccak/polyseer.git
cd polyseer
```

2. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
pnpm install
```

3. **Create `.env.local` file** in the project root with:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_MODE=development
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-...              # Get from platform.openai.com
VALYU_API_KEY=valyu_...                  # Get from platform.valyu.ai
```

4. **Start the app:**
```bash
pnpm dev
```

5. **Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)** and paste any Polymarket or Kalshi URL!

That's it. No database, no OAuth, no complicated setup.

---

## Production Setup (Advanced)

**⚠️ Only do this if you need user authentication and want to deploy this publicly.**

The production version uses Valyu OAuth for authentication and tracks user sessions in a database. It's more complicated.

### What You Need (in addition to above)
- **Supabase Account** - [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) (free tier is fine)
- **Valyu OAuth App** - Email [harvey@valyu.ai](mailto:harvey@valyu.ai) to request OAuth credentials

### Database Setup

1. **Create a Supabase project** at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)

2. **Run the setup SQL:**
   - Go to your Supabase dashboard
   - Click **"SQL Editor"** in the left sidebar
   - Click **"New Query"**
   - Copy/paste **everything** from `supabase/setup.sql`
   - Click **"Run"** (or press Cmd+Enter)
   - You should see "Success. No rows returned"

3. **Get your Supabase credentials:**
   - In Supabase dashboard, go to **Settings** → **API**
   - Copy the **URL** and **anon/public key**

### Environment Variables

Update your `.env.local` file:

```env
# ===========================================
# App Configuration
# ===========================================
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_MODE=production
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000

# ===========================================
# Required API Keys
# ===========================================
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-...              # Get from platform.openai.com
VALYU_API_KEY=valyu_...                  # Get from platform.valyu.ai

# ===========================================
# Supabase (Database)
# ===========================================
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://xxx.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJ...
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJ...  # Get from Settings → API → service_role key

# ===========================================
# Valyu OAuth (Request from harvey@valyu.ai)
# ===========================================
VALYU_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
VALYU_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
VALYU_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/api/auth/valyu/callback
```

### Start in Production Mode

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Now the app will require users to sign in with Valyu before using it.

## What is Polyseer?

Prediction markets tell you **what might happen**. Polyseer tells you **why**.

Drop in any **Polymarket or Kalshi** URL and get a structured analysis that breaks down the actual factors driving an outcome. Instead of gut feelings or surface-level takes, you get systematic research across academic papers, news, market data, and expert analysis.

**Core features:**
- Systematic research across academic, web, and market data sources
- Evidence classification and quality scoring
- Mathematical probability aggregation (not just vibes)
- Both sides research to avoid confirmation bias
- Real-time data, not stale information

Built for developers, researchers, and anyone who wants rigorous analysis instead of speculation.

---

## How It Works

Polyseer uses a **multi-agent AI system** to research markets:

1. **Planner Agent** - Breaks down the question into research pathways
2. **Researcher Agents** - Gather evidence from academic papers, news, and market data
3. **Critic Agent** - Identifies gaps and quality issues in the research
4. **Analyst Agent** - Combines evidence using Bayesian probability math
5. **Reporter Agent** - Generates the final human-readable report

### Evidence Quality System

Each piece of evidence is classified by quality:

| Type | Description | Examples |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **A** | Primary Sources | Official documents, press releases, regulatory filings |
| **B** | High-Quality Secondary | Reuters, Bloomberg, WSJ, expert analysis |
| **C** | Standard Secondary | Reputable news with citations |
| **D** | Weak/Speculative | Social media, unverified claims |

### Mathematical Foundation

Polyseer uses **Bayesian probability aggregation** to combine evidence:
- Each piece of evidence has a **log likelihood ratio** based on its quality
- Evidence is adjusted for **correlation** (to avoid double-counting similar sources)
- Final probability is calculated using **mathematical formulas**, not vibes

## Troubleshooting

### "Module not found" errors
```bash
rm -rf .next node_modules
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

### Database connection errors
- Make sure you ran `supabase/setup.sql` in your Supabase SQL editor
- Check your `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are correct

### Valyu API errors
- Make sure you have `VALYU_API_KEY` in your `.env.local`
- Check you have credits at [platform.valyu.ai](https://platform.valyu.ai)

### Still stuck?
Open an issue on GitHub or email [harvey@valyu.ai](mailto:harvey@valyu.ai)
