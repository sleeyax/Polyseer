# Polyseer - See the Future.

> *Everyone wishes they could go back and buy Bitcoin at $1. Polyseer brings the future to you, so you never have to wonder "what if?" again.*

**NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE** | Polyseer provides analysis for entertainment and research purposes only. Always DYOR.

## Quick Start (Self-Hosted)

The easiest way to run Polyseer is in self-hosted mode with just 3 environment variables:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yorkeccak/polyseer.git
cd polyseer
npm install

# Create .env.local with:
# NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_MODE=self-hosted
# VALYU_API_KEY=valyu_xxx        # Get from platform.valyu.ai
# OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxx          # Get from platform.openai.com

npm run dev
```

Open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), paste any **Polymarket or Kalshi** URL, and get your analysis.

Self-hosted mode features:
- No authentication required
- Local SQLite database (automatically created)
- Unlimited queries using your API keys
- Perfect for personal use and development

## What is Polyseer?

Prediction markets tell you what might happen. Polyseer tells you why.

Drop in any **Polymarket or Kalshi** URL and get a structured analysis that breaks down the actual factors driving an outcome. Instead of gut feelings or surface-level takes, you get systematic research across academic papers, news, market data, and expert analysis.

The system uses multiple AI agents to research both sides of a question, then aggregates the evidence using Bayesian probability math. Think of it as having a research team that can read thousands of sources in minutes and give you the key insights.

**Core features:**
- Systematic research across academic, web, and market data sources
- Evidence classification and quality scoring
- Mathematical probability aggregation (not just vibes)
- Both sides research to avoid confirmation bias
- Real-time data, not stale information

Built for developers, researchers, and anyone who wants rigorous analysis instead of speculation.

## Architecture Overview

Polyseer is built on a **multi-agent AI architecture** that orchestrates specialized agents to conduct deep analysis. Here's how it works:

```mermaid

    A[User Input: Market URL] --> B[Platform Detector]
    B --> C{Polymarket or Kalshi?}
    C -->|Polymarket| D[Polymarket API Client]
    C -->|Kalshi| E[Kalshi API Client]
    D --> F[Unified Market Data]

    C --> D[Planner Agent]
    D --> E[Research Agents]
    E --> F[Valyu Search Network]
    F --> G[Evidence Collection]
    G --> H[Critic Agent]
    H --> I[Analyst Agent]
    I --> J[Reporter Agent]
    J --> K[Final Verdict]

## Deep Research System

### Valyu Integration

Polyseer uses the Valyu API for its research capabilities, providing access to:

- **Academic Papers**: Real-time research publications
- **Web Intelligence**: Fresh news and analysis
- **Market Data**: Financial and trading information
- **Proprietary Datasets**: Exclusive Valyu intelligence

```mermaid

    A[Research Query] --> B[Valyu Deep Search]
    B --> C[Academic Sources]
    B --> D[Web Sources]
    B --> E[Market Data]

    C --> G[Evidence Classification]
    D --> G
    E --> G
    F --> G

    G --> H[Type A: Primary Sources]
    G --> I[Type B: High-Quality Secondary]
    G --> J[Type C: Standard Secondary]
    G --> K[Type D: Weak/Speculative]

    style H fill:#c8e6c9
    style I fill:#dcedc8
    style J fill:#f0f4c3
    style K fill:#ffcdd2
```

### Evidence Quality System

Each piece of evidence is rigorously classified:

| Type | Description | Cap | Examples |
|------|-------------|-----|----------|
| **A** | Primary Sources | 2.0 | Official documents, press releases, regulatory filings |
| **B** | High-Quality Secondary | 1.6 | Reuters, Bloomberg, WSJ, expert analysis |
| **C** | Standard Secondary | 0.8 | Reputable news with citations, industry publications |
| **D** | Weak/Speculative | 0.3 | Social media, unverified claims, rumors |

## Mathematical Foundation

### Bayesian Probability Aggregation

Polyseer uses sophisticated mathematical models to combine evidence:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Prior Probability p0] --> B[Evidence Weights]
    B --> C[Log Likelihood Ratios]
    C --> D[Correlation Adjustments]
    D --> E[Cluster Analysis]
    E --> F[Final Probabilities]

    F --> G[pNeutral: Objective Assessment]
    F --> H[pAware: Market-Informed]

    style A fill:#e3f2fd
    style F fill:#c8e6c9
    style G fill:#dcedc8
    style H fill:#f0f4c3
```

**Key Formulas:**
- **Log Likelihood Ratio**: `LLR = log(P(evidence|YES) / P(evidence|NO))`
- **Probability Update**: `p_new = p_old * exp(LLR)`
- **Correlation Adjustment**: Accounts for evidence clustering and dependencies

### Evidence Influence Calculation

Each piece of evidence receives an influence score based on:
- **Verifiability**: Can the claim be independently verified?
- **Consistency**: Internal logical coherence
- **Independence**: Number of independent corroborations
- **Recency**: How fresh is the information?

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/polyseer.git
cd polyseer
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
